**2.1 Product Specific Terms.** The **_Daedalus Wallet Terms_** are incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

**2.2 Use.** By using Daedalus, User acknowledges and agrees: (i) that the Company is not responsible for operation of the underlying protocols and that the Company makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (&quot;forks&quot;), and that such forks may materially affect the value, and/or function of the ada or any other cryptocurrency that User stores on Daedalus. In the event of a fork, User agrees that the Company may temporarily suspend Daedalus operations (with or without notice to User) and that the Company may, in its sole discretion, (a) configure or reconfigure its systems or (b) decide not to support (or cease supporting) the forked protocol entirely, provided, however, that User will have an opportunity to withdraw funds from Daedalus. User acknowledges and agrees that the Company assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.

**2.3 Customer Obligations.** User is solely responsible for the confidentiality of User&#39;s security devices, information, keys, or passwords including safekeeping User&#39;s wallet recovery phrases, passwords, private keys, and any other codes User uses to access Daedalus or any information, ada, or other cryptocurrency unit. If User loses access to User&#39;s cryptocurrency wallet or private keys and has not separately stored a backup of User&#39;s wallet recovery phrase(s), User acknowledges and agrees that any ada or any other cryptocurrencies User has associated with that cryptocurrency wallet will become inaccessible. All transactions accepted by Cardano network are irreversible except transactions reversed by temporary forks in Cardano network.

**2.4 User Wallet Recovery Phrases.** User agrees that User should never share User&#39;s wallet recovery phrases (secret keys) with any natural or legal person, including the Company. Further, User acknowledges that sharing User&#39;s wallet recovery phrase may result in loss of User&#39;s ada or any other cryptocurrency, and User agrees that the Company shall not be responsible for such loss.

**2.5 Liability.** The Company and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents cannot guarantee transaction confirmation or the ability to retrieve User&#39;s cryptocurrency or wallet recovery phrases, private keys or passwords if User loses or forgets them. The Company shall not be responsible for such loss howsoever caused. User acknowledges and agrees that ada or any other cryptocurrency transactions facilitated by Daedalus and/or the Company may be delayed or rejected, and that the Company shall not be responsible for any associated loss arising from such delay.

## 3. Special Terms - Incentivised Testnet, Delegation and Staking

**3.1 Incentivised Testnet.** Company is testing and making available to Users a test rewards and incentivization mechanism which is intended to mimic the rewards and incentivization mechanism in the upcoming Shelley release (the &quot;Incentivized Testnet&quot;). Users may participate in the Incentivized Testnet by delegating their ada stake to their own stake pool or to a third party stake pool in exchange for a reward equivalent to a percentage of the proceeds generated by the stake pool (&quot;Reward&quot;).

**3.2 Rewards.** The amount of Rewards a User may earn from delegation depends on various factors including, but not limited to, user participation, stakepool profit margins and the volume of ada being delegated. It is possible that delegation generates no Reward for a User due to the above-mentioned factors. Rewards are earned as of the start of the 3rd epoch on the Cardano blockchain. When the Incentivized Testnet is discontinued, any Rewards earned can be transferred back to the User’s Daedalus or Yoroi wallet.

**3.3 Delegation.** Users may delegate their stake to one of the various stake pools of the Company or to a third party stake pool. User will have the sole right to determine the volume to be delegated to a stake pool and may increase or decrease its level of participation at any time. Any information Company shares regarding stakepools, including performance metrics and Rewards, will be for indicative purposes only and may not be accurate. Users may only delegate their stake to a stake pool if their ada is in an updated Daedalus or an updated Yoroi wallet at the time of the setup process. User does not acquire any automatic right to Rewards as a result of delegating its stake.

**3.4 Company Stake-Pools.** The Company will operate various stake pools which will be visible in Daedalus or the explorer tool. The cost and network and server requirements to reliably operate such stake pools shall be determined by the Company in its sole discretion. Company will communicate the percentage amount of Reward to be shared with Users through the User’s Testnet Daedalus wallet. Rewards will accrue at the end of each epoch and will automatically appear in the User’s Testnet Deadalus wallet. Company will provide a dashboard detailing the Company’s staking performance to User.

**3.5 Redeeming Rewards.** User acknowledges and agrees that by redeeming Rewards in the Incentivised Testnet, User redeems TEST-ADA only, and that in order to redeem actual ada, User must repeat the procedure in the mainnet, once released. User shall be responsible for payment of all applicable taxes, if any, to which the Rewards might be subject and any and all other taxes which may apply to User once Rewards are redeemed.

**3.6 Tools.** Company will provide Users and stake pool operators certain tools designed to estimate the amount of Rewards a User may earn on the Incentivized Testnet (&quot;Rewards Calculator&quot;). User understands that the Rewards Calculator is provided for illustrative purposes only and may not be accurate. Company does not promise that the Reward received will correspond to the amount indicated by the Rewards Calculator or by the stake pools.

**3.7 Prohibited Use.** User will not, and will not permit any other third party to use any device, software or routine to interfere with the proper function of the Incentivised Testnet. If there is a complaint or notice of violation, a User’s participation may be suspended without notice until resolved, and terminated if not resolved promptly.

**3.8 Warranty.** The Service are provided to User on an &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot; basis and all warranties, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service are hereby excluded. User acknowledges that the Incentivized Testnet may not operate properly and that it may contain errors, design flaws or other issues. User’s use of the Incentivized Testnet remains at User’s risk and discretion. IOHK reserves the right to restart the Incentivised Testnet and reverse all or some Rewards in the case of errors and/or malicious behaviour in the system.

**3.9 Termination of the Incentivised Testnet.** User understands and agrees that Company may change, withdraw, terminate access to and/or discontinue the Incentivized Testnet (or any portion thereof) at any time and in its sole discretion. User may end participation in the Incentivized Testnet at any time and any Rewards gained up to that time will still be transferred to User’s Daedalus or Yoroi mainnet wallet once the Incentivized Testnet is discontinued.

**3.10 Feedback.** Users may provide suggestions, comments or ideas and report issues or problems related to their use of the Incentivized Testnet at any time by using any of the official feedback channels.

## 4. Special Terms - Pre-Release Products

**4.1** From time to time, the Company may test certain products and make them available to Users under this Agreement as pre-release products (each, a &quot;Pre-Release Product&quot;). 

**4.2** ANY PRE-RELEASE PRODUCT PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY IS STILL IN TESTING PHASE AND IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; BASIS AND IS BELIEVED TO CONTAIN DEFECTS. A PRIMARY PURPOSE OF OFFERING PRODUCTS UNDER PRE-RELEASE IS TO OBTAIN FEEDBACK ON THE PRODUCT PERFORMANCE. USERS ARE ADVISED TO SAFEGUARD IMPORTANT DATA, TO USE CAUTION AND NOT RELY IN ANY WAY ON THE CORRECT FUNCTIONING OR PERFORMANCE OF A PRE-RELEASE PRODUCT AND/OR ACCOMPANYING MATERIALS.

**4.3** With respect to each Pre-Release Product, the term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and will continue until the end of the testing of such Pre-Release Product, which occurs on the earlier of (i) the date specified by us in our sole discretion or otherwise agreed to between the parties in writing (unless earlier terminated) (after which you will cease use of such Beta Product), or (ii) the date we (in our sole discretion) make such Beta Product generally publicly available as a non Pre-Release Product (after which any permitted use will no longer be subject to these Special Terms). 

**4.4** Product-specific terms and policies may also apply to your use of a Beta Product (eg &quot;Daedalus Wallet Terms&quot;). In such case, Product Terms will be made available to you (as part of these terms or separately) and will also apply to your use of the Beta Product. By continuing to access, test or use any Beta Product, you agree to also be bound by the Product specific terms.
