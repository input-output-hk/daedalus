# Daedalus TLS setup


## Cardano Wallet

Starting with Cardano 1.3.0 version TLS certificates are autogenerated on each application start on the Cardano side and provided to Daedalus via launcher `tlsPath` variable. Since launcher is not used in development mode, developers are expected to set `CARDANO_TLS_PATH` environment variable which points to their local Cardano TLS files directory: `{path-to-cardano-sl}/run/tls-files/`.

## Mantis Wallet

Mantis integration also provides correct TLS files through launcher variable in production mode while in development mode Daedalus is using certificates from `daedalus/tls/` directory.
