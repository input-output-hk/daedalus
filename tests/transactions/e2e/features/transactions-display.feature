Feature: Display wallet transactions

  The wallet summary screen displays the five most recent transactions,
  sorted by creation date (newest first). If there are more than five
  transactions it shows a "show more transactions" button to redirect
  to the wallet transactions screen where all are listed.

  Background:
    Given I have completed the basic setup
    And I have a "Test Wallet" wallet with funds
    And I have the following wallets:
      | name          |
      | Target Wallet |

  Scenario: No recent transactions
    When I am on the "Target Wallet" wallet "summary" screen
    Then I should not see any transactions
    And I should see the no recent transactions message
    When I am on the "Target Wallet" wallet "transactions" screen
    Then I should not see any transactions
    And I should see the no recent transactions message
