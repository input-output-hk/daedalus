    And I have a "Balance Wallet" balance wallet

  Scenario: Successfully deleting "Daedalus Balance" wallet from settings screen
    And I am on the "Balance Wallet" wallet "settings" screen
    When I click on delete wallet button
    And I see delete wallet dialog
    And I click on the "Make sure you have access to backup before continuing" checkbox
    And I enter "Balance Wallet" as name of the wallet to confirm
    And I submit the delete wallet dialog
    Then I should not see the delete wallet dialog anymore
