  Scenario: "Daedalus Balance" wallet is shown on the bottom of the list below "Daedalus Rewards" wallet in order of creation
    And I have created the following wallets:
      | name     |
      | Wallet 1 |
      | Wallet 2 |
      | Wallet 3 |
      | Wallet 4 |
      | Wallet 5 |
    Then I should see the wallets in the following order:
      | name           |
      | Wallet 1       |
      | Wallet 2       |
      | Wallet 3       |
